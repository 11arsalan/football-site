          <b>Haaland wins second successive Premier League Golden Boot</b>
          <p>
            The Norwegian striker is again the league’s leading marksman, with
            his haul of 27 goals beating runner up Cole Palmer of Chelsea, who
            scored 22 times.

            He has enjoyed an unbelievable first two seasons at City, claiming
            six major honours including back-to-back Premier League titles as
            part of our record-breaking run of four in a row.

              “To win the Golden Boot again is very special for me,” he said.

            Man City boss Pep Guardiola.</b
          >
          <p>
            Pep Guardiola suspects Phil Foden will have to drop out of the
            England squad due to a virus. Foden started every match on England’s
            run to the final of Euro 2024 this summer but missed Manchester
            City’s 4-1 win over Ipswich Town and Saturday’s 3-1 win at West Ham
            after feeling discomfort against Chelsea on the opening weekend.
          </p>

          <p>
            <i>
              On Thursday, Foden was named in Lee Carsley’s first England squad
              since becoming interim manager, but Guardiola has continued to
              cast doubt on the 24-year-old’s inclusion in Nations League games
              against the Republic of Ireland and Finland. Asked whether Foden
              is likely to feature for the Three Lions Guardiola responded: “I
              don’t think so right now. I think he will not go, but I don’t
              know. “He doesn’t feel well — otherwise he would be here. But like
              I said before, national teams decide.”</i
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Guardiola explained it is illness keeping Foden out, adding: “He
            doesn’t feel good. It’s his stomach, a little, little virus. Some
            people said antibiotics and so on will be fine.” Foden has scored
            four goals in 41 appearances for England since making his
            international debut against Iceland in September 2020.
