    <h1>Manchester City's Historical Achievements</h1>
    <h2>1880–1928</h2>

        <b>
          Members of St. Mark's Church of England, West Gorton, Manchester,
          founded the football club that would become known as Manchester City
          for largely humanitarian purposes. Two church wardens sought to curb
          local gang violence and alcoholism by instituting new activities for
          local men, whilst high unemployment plagued East Manchester,
          specifically Gorton. All men were welcome to join, regardless of
          religion. A church cricket club had been formed in 1875, but no
          equivalent for the winter months existed.[2] </b
        ><i
          >To rectify this, and as part of Rector Arthur Connell's general push
          to intervene in social ills, church wardens William Beastow and Thomas
          Goodbehere, who held senior positions at the Union Iron Works,[3]
          started a church football team called St Mark's (West Gorton),
          sometimes written as West Gorton (St Mark's), in the winter of
          1880.[4] The team's first recorded match occurred on 13 November 1880,
          against a church team from Macclesfield. St. Marks lost the match 2–1,
          and only won one match during their inaugural 1880–81 season, with a
          victory over Stalybridge Clarence in March 1881.[5] City gained their
          first honours by winning the Second Division in 1899; with it came
          promotion to the highest level in English football, the First
          Division. They went on to claim their first major honour on 23 April
          1904, beating Bolton Wanderers 1–0 at Crystal Palace to win the FA
          Cup; City narrowly missed out on a League and Cup double that season
          after finishing runners-up in the League but City became the first
          club in Manchester</i
        >
        to win a major honour.[6] In the seasons following the FA Cup triumph,
        the club was dogged by allegations of financial irregularities,
        culminating in the suspension of seventeen players in 1906, including
        captain Billy Meredith, who subsequently moved across town to Manchester
        United.[7] A fire at Hyde Road destroyed the main stand in 1920, and in
        1923 the club moved to their new purpose-built stadium at Maine Road in
        Moss Side.[8]

        <u>
          In the 1930s, Manchester City reached two consecutive FA Cup finals,
          losing to Everton in 1933, before claiming the Cup by beating
          Portsmouth in 1934.[9] During the 1934 cup run, Manchester City broke
          the record for the highest home attendance of any club in English
          football history, as 84,569 fans packed Maine Road for a sixth round
          FA Cup tie against Stoke City in 1934—a record which still stands to
          this day.[10] The club won the First Division title for the first time
          in 1937, but were relegated the following season, despite scoring more
          goals than any other team in the division.[11] Twenty years later, a
          City team inspired by a tactical system known as the Revie Plan
          reached consecutive FA Cup finals again,</u
        >
        in 1955 and 1956; just as in the 1930s, they lost the first one, to
        Newcastle United, and won the second. The 1956 final, in which
        Manchester City beat Birmingham City 3–1, is one of the most famous
        finals of all-time, and is remembered for City goalkeeper Bert Trautmann
        continuing to play on after unknowingly breaking his neck.[12]

    <h2>1965–2001</h2>
    <div class="history">
      <p class="history-para">
        After relegation to the Second Division in 1963, the future looked bleak
        with a record low home attendance of 8,015 against Swindon Town in
        January 1965.[13] In the summer of 1965, the management team of Joe
        Mercer and Malcolm Allison was appointed. In the first season under
        Mercer, City won the Second Division title and made important signings
        in Mike Summerbee and Colin Bell.[14] Two seasons later, in 1967–68,
        Manchester City claimed the League Championship for the second time,
        clinching the title on the final day of the season with a 4–3 win at
        Newcastle United and beating their close neighbours Manchester United
        into second place.[15] Further trophies followed: City won the FA Cup in
        1969, before achieving European success by winning the European Cup
        Winners' Cup in 1970, beating Górnik Zabrze 2–1 in Vienna.[16] City also
        won the League Cup that season, becoming the second English team to win
        a European trophy and a domestic trophy in the same season. The club
        continued to challenge for honours throughout the 1970s, finishing one
        point behind the league champions on two occasions and reaching the
        final of the 1974 League Cup.[17]<u>
          One of the matches from this period that is most fondly remembered by
          supporters of Manchester City is the final match of the 1973–74 season
          against arch-rivals Manchester United, who needed to win to have any
          hope of avoiding relegation. Former United player Denis Law scored
          with a backheel to give City a 1–0 win at Old Trafford and confirm the
          relegation of their rivals.[18][19] The final trophy of the club's
          most successful period was won in 1976, when Newcastle United were
          beaten 2–1 in the League Cup final. A long period of decline followed
          the success of the 1960s and 1970s. Malcolm Allison rejoined the club
          to become manager for the second time in 1979, but squandered large
          sums of money on unsuccessful signings,</u
        >
        <b>
          such as Steve Daley.[20] A succession of managers then followed –
          seven in the 1980s alone. Under John Bond, City reached the 1981 FA
          Cup final but lost in a replay to Tottenham Hotspur. The club were
          twice relegated from the top flight in the 1980s (in 1983 and 1987),
          but returned to the top flight again in 1989 and finished fifth in
          1991 and 1992 under the management of Peter Reid.[21] </b
        >However, this was only a temporary respite, and following Reid's
        departure Manchester City's fortunes continued to fade. City were
        co-founders of the Premier League upon its creation in 1992, but after
        finishing ninth in its first season they endured three seasons of
        struggle before being relegated in 1996. After two seasons in Division
        One, City fell to the lowest point in their history, becoming the second
        ever European trophy winners to be relegated to their country's third
        league tier, after 1. FC Magdeburg of Germany.

    <h2>2001–present</h2>
    <div class="history">
      <p class="history-para">
        After relegation, the club underwent off-the-field upheaval, with new
        chairman David Bernstein introducing greater fiscal discipline.[22] City
        were promoted at the first attempt, achieved in dramatic fashion in a
        play-off against Gillingham.<i>
          A second successive promotion saw City return to the top division, but
          this proved to have been a step too far for the recovering club, and
          in 2001 City were relegated once more. Kevin Keegan arrived as the new
          manager in the close season, bringing an immediate return to the top
          division as the club won the 2001–02 Division One championship,
          breaking club records for the number of points gained and goals scored
          in a season in the process.[23] The 2002–03 season was the last at
          Maine Road, and included a 3–1 derby victory over rivals Manchester
          United, ending a run of 13 years without a derby win.[24] City also
          qualified for European competition for the first time in 25 years. In
          the 2003 close season the club moved to the new City of Manchester
          Stadium. The first four seasons at the stadium all resulted in
          mid-table finishes. Former England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson became
          the club's first manager from overseas when appointed in 2007.[25]
          After a bright start performances faded in the second half of the
          season, and Eriksson was sacked in June 2008.[26] Eriksson was
          replaced by Mark Hughes two days later on 4 June 2008.[27] By 2008,
          the club was in a financially precarious position. Thaksin Shinawatra
          had taken control of the club a year before, but his political
          travails saw his assets frozen.[28] Then, in August 2008, the club was
          purchased by the Abu Dhabi United Group. The takeover was immediately
          followed by a flurry of bids for high-profile players; the club broke
          the British transfer record by signing Brazilian international Robinho
          from Real Madrid for £32.5 million.[29] Performances were not a huge
          improvement on the previous season despite the influx of money
          however, with the team finishing tenth, although they did well to
          reach the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup. During the summer of 2009,
          the club took transfer spending to an unprecedented level, with an
          outlay of over £100 million on players Gareth Barry, Roque Santa Cruz,
          Kolo Touré, Emmanuel Adebayor, Carlos Tevez and Joleon Lescott.[30] In
          December 2009, Mark Hughes—who had been hired shortly before the
          change in ownership but was originally retained by the new board—was
          replaced as manager by Roberto Mancini.[31] City finished the season
          in fifth position in the Premier League, narrowly missing out on a
          place in the Champions League, and competed in the UEFA Europa League
          in season 2010–11.</i
